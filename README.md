# AIG Shields Up - Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program

This repository contains my completed tasks for the **AIG Cybersecurity Job Simulation** offered via Forage. The simulation involved real-world security scenarios like vulnerability response and basic incident response automation.

## Contents

### 🔐 Task 1: Responding to a Zero-Day Vulnerability
- Drafted a professional advisory for the Apache Log4j (CVE-2021-44228) vulnerability.
- Simulated communication with internal teams regarding impact and recommended actions.

### 🧩 Task 2: Bypassing Ransomware (Brute-force Decryption)
- Wrote a Python script to brute-force the password of a ZIP file using the RockYou wordlist.
- Demonstrates automation and scripting skills for real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

### 📄 Final Report
- The full documentation of tasks, steps taken, and outputs from the job simulation is included in the `Forage_Report` folder.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- RockYou.txt dictionary (common password list)
- ZIP file handling (`zipfile` module)
- Security concepts: CVEs, brute-forcing, patch advisory

## 🏁 Outcome
Successfully completed the AIG Cybersecurity Simulation via Forage. This project reflects core skills in incident response, scripting, and vulnerability communication.
