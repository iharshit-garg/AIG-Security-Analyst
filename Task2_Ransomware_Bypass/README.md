# Brute-Force ZIP Password Script

This Python script performs a brute-force attack on a password-protected ZIP file (`enc.zip`) using a wordlist (`rockyou.txt`). It automates the decryption process by attempting each password line-by-line.

## Usage

1. Place `enc.zip` and `rockyou.txt` in the same directory.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python3 zip_bruteforce.py
